# RetabSource
Automatically convert your source code's spaces to tabs, used when your intellisense isn't smiling at your spaces/tabs in your source code.

## Installation
Place the source code somewhere and add the 'bin' folder to your PATH.

## Running
Assuming most of the files are spaces only, run by `retabsrc` on the terminal, it will ask for the amount of spaces to convert to a tab.
Once it's successfully done, you can replace the `src` folder with the `tabbed` folder. :thumbsup:
